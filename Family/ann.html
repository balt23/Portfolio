          Ann Elizabeth Myers was born on May 10, 1951 in Tiffin, Ohio and died on June 28, 2018 in Columbus, Ohio at the age of 67. 
          <br><br>
          Ann was predeceased by her parents Milton and Jean Krotzer. She is survived by her loving husband of 33 years, Marc Myers. Ann is also survived by sister, Alice (Will) Alt; brother, Bill Krotzer; nieces Christine (Johnny) Siemens and Lisa (Danny) Arceneaux and nephew Brian Alt. She also is survived by eight great-nieces and great-nephews. 
          <br><br>
          Ann battled ovarian cancer for 9 years with incredible strength and courage. She never complained and always had a positive attitude. She endured more than most persons could endure. She was so strong! 
          <br><br>
          She taught elementary school in Lancaster, Ohio for 11 years before beginning her teaching career in Dublin. She taught at Olde Sawmill, Wyandot, Scottish Corners and Indian Run, before retiring in 2012 after 28 years in Dublin. She loved teaching, her students, and her fellow teachers. 
          <br><br>
          Ann was a member of the Lutheran Church. 
          <br><br>
          She also loved her volunteer work at the Franklin Park Conservatory and the Upper Arlington Public Library, with the many friends she made at those places. Ann was kind and generous to all. She never met a stranger. 
          <br><br>
          She had no idea the positive impact she had on so many people because she was so humble and unassuming. She never called attention to herself. 
          <br><br>
          She will be incredibly missed by all. She will never be forgotten. 
          <br><br>
          Special thanks to the PALS and Sandy, with whom she spent many happy hours. Thanks also to all those who sent her cards, came to see her at her last hospital stay, and contacted the family. 
          <br><br>
          Services have been entrusted to Schoedinger Worthington Chapel, 6699 North High Street, Worthington, Ohio 43085. There will be a visitation on Thursday July 5, 2018 from 2pm-4pm and 6pm-7pm followed by a Memorial Service at 7pm. 
          <br><br>
          The family requests in lieu of flowers donations be made to Kobacher House, 800 McConnell Drive, Columbus, Ohio 43214 or Pelatonia, 351 West Nationwide Blvd., Columbus, OH 43215 in Ann's name.

I was so sorry to hear of Ann's passing. I taught fifth grade with Ann at Olde Sawmill Elementary in the 1980's, and although I've not had contact with her in recent years, I will always remember her kindness and sense of humor. She was a special person. 
<br><br>
My thoughts are with her husband and family.
