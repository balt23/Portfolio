Alice Alt, 71, of Plano, passed away on Thursday, April 11, 2019. 
<br><br>          
She was born on December 18, 1947, in Tiffin, Ohio, to the late Milton and Jean (Young) Krotzer.
<br><br>          
Graduating from Tiffin Columbian High School in 1966, she went on to attend Bliss College in Columbus, Ohio. Alice was employed by Mercy Hospital for a number of years as well as the Columbus Symphony Orchestra and J.C. Penney Co. After moving to Plano, she worked as a cook in the schools until becoming a food service manager for PISD.
<br><br>
Alice met the love of her life, Will Alt, on a blind date after being introduced by Will‚Äôs cousin for square dancing in Tiffin, Ohio. They enjoyed 47 years of marriage and built a beautiful family together.
<br><br>
Alice was devoted to her Catholic faith. She was a member of St. Mark‚Äôs Catholic Church in Plano, where she was involved in the folk choir, Catholic Daughters (CDA), Ladies Auxillary Knights of Columbus, but most enjoyed her ministry of rosary making.
<br><br>
Alice was a member of the Dallas Amputee Network (DAN) and found comfort in the support she found there. She was a life-long Girl Scout and enjoyed scrapbooking. Sending greeting cards for every occasion, or even a non-occasion, brought Alice joy in brightening another person‚Äôs day with a meaningful message. During her 10 year medical condition, many found her to be an inspiration.
<br><br>
Most of all, she loved her family and valued each moment with them. Alice adored her family, especially her grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Her caring spirit will live on in the lives of those who loved her. She will be greatly missed by all who knew her.
<br><br>
In addition to her parents, Alice was preceded in death by her sister, Ann Myers. She is survived by her devoted husband of 47 years, Will Alt; children, Christine (Johnny) Siemens of San Antonio, Lisa (Danny) Arceneaux of Carrollton, and Brian Alt of Austin; eight grandchildren and 2 great-grandchildren; brother, Bill Krotzer of Athens, Ohio; brother-in-laws, Marc Myers, Jerome Alt, Steven Alt, Fr. Ken Alt; and sister-in-law, Janette Ruffing, all of Ohio.
<br><br>
Visitation will be held on Tuesday, April 16, 2019 from 7-9pm in Ted Dickey West Funeral Home, Dallas, with a Rosary Vigil Service beginning at 8pm. A Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated on Wednesday, April 17, 2019 at 10:30am in St. Mark Catholic Church, 1201 Alma Drive, Plano, TX 75075 with Fr. Clifford Smith as Celebrant. Burial will be in Sacred Heart Cemetery, Rowlett. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to the American Heart Association, 7272 Greenville Ave., Dallas, TX 75231, or to St. Mark Catholic Church.

I have such wonderful memories of singing with Alice in the Diocesan Choir. We sat together in the alto section, and it was always uplifting to be in her positive and affirming presence. She was so proud of her family and so devoted to her faith. May God comfort all of her loved ones, and may we all learn from her example.

Will: Since I met y'all 10 years ago, you and Alice have been an inspiration, one of the linchpin couples at St. Mark, such a team. Alice was simply remarkable, touching so many lives despite her physical challenges--whether she was leading and shaping the Knights of Columbus Ladies Auxiliary, or stringing hundreds of mission rosaries, or simply offering her lovely smile. Am so sorry for your loss, and pray you and your family's sorrow will ease knowing that Alice herself will experience perfect peace with our Lord. God bless

You are a wonderful example to all of a loving and dedicated caregiver. May God‚Äôs blessings be with all of you now and forever.
<br><br>
Sincerely,<br>

May you find peace in the loss of your mom. Remember the memories and keep them close to your heart. It's ok to show emotions as you deal with this hard time in your life. Your heart will be empty forever and you will never be able to replace this hurt in your heart but God gives you the strength to move on as we know this is what your mom would want you to do, . May she rest in peace. My thoughts and prayers are with you and your family. 
<br><br>          
Love Theresa Godfrey

The Alts have been an extended part of my family for 14 years, ever since my son, Danny, married Lisa, Alice's youngest daughter. The family has always been so inviting & generous in welcoming me & my family on so many holidays & special occasions. And, no one was ever more loving & kind than Alice. She was the heart of the family & always ready to share her love. I am eternally grateful & will miss her deeply.
I wish Will & the family peace & comfort in knowing that she was loved & honored by all those who knew her. I will keep you all in my prayers.
<br><br>          
God bless Alice & her family. May she rest in the loving arms of our Lord until we meet again.üôè‚ù§

I am so sorry to hear of Alice's passing. She was a great neighbor in Lakewood, Ohio when I was growing up. She was also a great inspiration to so many after her medical problems several years ago. She will be greatly missed but fondly remembered. Peace to the whole family and all of Alice's friends.

Alice and Will, We have known you both for many years and shared many events. I know how the last few years have been very difficult for you both. Will has been a wonderful caretaker for you Alice. I know how hard you worked the last few years to peak out yourself. We will miss you Alice but know you are in a better place where you are again complete.
